// Wraps our application in what we call an apollo provider
// There are several ways to do this but the best way of doing this is via higher-order component
// Meaning that anytime you have a page and it wants to use apollo you gotta wrap it in higher order component
// This might not be the most elegat solution in terms of code duplication but apparently using the _app.js
// causes there to be some performance issues
